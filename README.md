![Demo Screenshot](demo_screenshot.png) <!-- Add a screenshot later -->

A deep learning-powered web application for classifying chest X-ray images into four categories: COVID-19, Lung Opacity, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. The system provides Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize model decisions and clinical recommendations for each diagnosis.

## Features

- üè• Medical Image Classification: Identifies 4 pulmonary conditions
- üîç Explainable AI: Visual model explanations using Grad-CAM
- üö® Clinical Guidance: Professional medical recommendations
- üìä Probability Scores: Shows confidence levels for each diagnosis
- üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface: User-friendly Streamlit application

## Technical Specifications

- Model Architecture: ResNet50 (custom final layer)
- Input: 224√ó224 RGB chest X-ray images
- Output: Classification probabilities with explanations
- Framework: PyTorch + TorchVision
- Interface: Streamlit web app
